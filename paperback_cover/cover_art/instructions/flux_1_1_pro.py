# General Guidelines

1. Be specific and descriptive  
   Provide clear details about the subject, environment, and style.  
   Instead of a general subject, describe unique features and context.  
   Example:  
   - "a woman" (too vague)  
   - "A woman with curly hair, wearing a red dress, standing in a sunflower field" (clear and detailed)  

2. Use natural language  
   Write prompts in full sentences or phrases as you would describe an image to a person.  
   Avoid disjointed keyword lists.  
   Example:  
   - "sunset, mountain, sky" (unclear)  
   - "A serene sunset over a mountain with pastel hues in the sky" (well-structured)  


# Syntax and Formatting

1. No special syntax needed  
   Use proper punctuation and spacing for clarity.  
   Complete sentences generally give better results than a keyword list.  

2. Emphasizing important elements  
   Some tools may allow weighting for emphasis.  
   Repeating a word or enclosing it in parentheses can stress its importance.  
   In most cases, a well-written prompt is enough.  

3. Avoid ambiguity  
   Clearly specify key attributes, composition, and other important details.  
   Example:  
   - "person" (too vague)  
   - "A close-up portrait of a person with blue eyes and a confident expression" (clear)  

# Example Prompts

1. "A fantasy landscape illustration of a castle on a cliff, with waterfalls cascading down to a lush valley, golden sunset lighting the sky."  
   - This describes the subject, setting, and lighting for a coherent image.  

2. "Portrait of a Victorian-era gentleman in a dark room, Rembrandt lighting, highly detailed oil painting style."  
   - This specifies the subject, era, lighting, and artistic style.
