# General Guidelines

1. Be Concise yet Clear  
   Keep prompts short but specific.  
   Photon works best with brief phrases that clearly define the subject and style.  
   Example:  
   - "A tabby cat wearing sunglasses, cartoon style."  
   - Includes subject (cat), attribute (sunglasses), and style (cartoon).  

2. Use Action-Oriented Descriptions  
   Adding a verb or action makes the image more dynamic.  
   Example:  
   - "A dog splashing in a puddle."  
   - "A car racing down a highway at sunset."  

3. Incorporate Specific Keywords  
   Choose strong, relevant nouns and adjectives.  
   If a specific style is needed, include it clearly (e.g., "pixel art," "steampunk," "portrait photo").  
   Avoid excessive descriptors—clarity is more important than length.  

# Syntax and Formatting

1. Keep Prompts Short  
   A single sentence or phrase (5–15 words) works best.  
   Example:  
   - "Space astronaut cat, digital illustration, galaxy background."  

2. Simple Structure  
   Use commas or conjunctions to separate key elements.  
   Example:  
   - "Robot chef, cooking in kitchen, bright comic style."  

3. Avoid Overly Complex Grammar  
   Photon does not require elaborate sentence structure.  
   Too much detail can confuse the model.  
   Stick to a primary idea and a few clarifying details.  

4. Leverage Parameters if Available  
   Aspect ratio, reference images, and other settings should be adjusted in the UI,  
   not within the text prompt.  
   Example:  
   - Instead of saying "widescreen," adjust the aspect ratio in the interface.  

# Example Prompts

1. "Robot bartender pouring a glowing drink, cyberpunk artstyle."  
   - Defines the subject (robot bartender), action (pouring a drink), and style (cyberpunk).  

2. "Majestic tiger, realistic portrait photo, soft lighting."  
   - Specifies the subject (tiger) with clear style and lighting details.
