# General Guidelines

1. Use Complete Sentences  
   - Write prompts as full sentences with proper grammar.  
   - Example: "A black T-shirt with a bold graphic on the front."  
   - Example: "A logo design featuring a mountain and a river."  

2. Clearly State the Visual Context for Text  
   - If you want text to appear in the image, specify both the text and its placement.  
   - Example: "A billboard in Times Square that says 'Welcome Home'."  
   - Mention placement like "on a neon sign" or "on a book cover" for better integration.  

3. Leverage Styles and Genres  
   - Specify an art style to influence the output.  
   - Example: "A comic-book style illustration of a superhero."  
   - If no style is mentioned, the AI will select one based on context.  

# Syntax and Formatting  

1. Quotations for Text  
   - Put specific words or phrases in double quotes.  
   - Example: "A street sign with the word 'STOP' in bold red letters."  
   - Only quote the text that should appear in the image.  

2. Describe Placement and Style of Text  
   - Specify where the text appears and how it should look.  
   - Example: "A movie poster titled 'Nightfall' at the top, in vintage font."  

3. One Language at a Time  
   - Works best with English letters and common symbols.  
   - Non-Latin alphabets may not render correctly.  

4. No Need for Manual Font Specifiers  
   - Instead of naming a font, describe the style.  
   - Example: "Handwritten cursive script" or "bold block letters."  

5. Combine Visual Elements and Text  
   - Describe both imagery and text in the same prompt.  
   - Example: "A travel poster of Paris with an illustration of the Eiffel Tower, and the slogan 'City of Light' at the bottom."  

# Example Prompts  

1. "A neon sign hanging in a window that says 'Open 24/7', with a soft pink and blue glow lighting up a dark street."  
2. "A modern logo design for a coffee shop named 'Java Bliss', featuring a simple coffee cup icon and stylish text."
