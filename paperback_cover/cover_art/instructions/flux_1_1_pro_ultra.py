# General Guidelines

1. Be specific and descriptive  
   Provide clear details about the subject, environment, and style.  
   Avoid vague descriptions and focus on distinct features.  
   Example:  
   - "A woman" (too general)  
   - "A woman with curly hair, wearing a red dress, standing in a sunflower field" (clear and detailed)  

2. Include fine details  
   Describe intricate textures, background elements, or small objects.  
   Example:  
   - "Distant mountains with tiny villages visible in the background"  
   - "Tiny engravings on an antique pocket watch"  

3. Use natural language  
   Write prompts as full sentences or descriptive phrases.  
   Avoid keyword lists.  
   Example:  
   - "Sunset, mountain, sky" (unclear)  
   - "A golden sunset over a rugged mountain range, with a deep blue sky above" (descriptive)  

# Syntax and Formatting

1. Write in clear, structured sentences  
   Use proper punctuation and spacing for clarity.  
   Complete descriptions provide better results than short phrases.  

2. Emphasize important details  
   If a detail is crucial, describe it explicitly.  
   Example:  
   - "A finely woven silk scarf with intricate golden embroidery"  

3. Avoid unnecessary resolution tags  
   The model automatically generates high-quality images.  
   Terms like "4K" or "high resolution" are not needed, but descriptions like "high detail" can help emphasize clarity.  

# Example Prompts

1. "A detailed aerial view of a bustling medieval market square at noon â€“ tiny figures buying and selling goods, stalls with colorful fabrics, sunlight and shadows showing the depth of buildings, distant castle walls in the background."  
   - Uses fine details to create a rich scene.  

2. "Close-up macro photograph of a red rose covered in morning dew, each water droplet reflecting light, incredibly sharp focus on the petal texture, soft blurred background."  
   - Describes lighting, texture, and depth for a photorealistic effect.
